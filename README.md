## About Me
My name is Justin Goncalves, and I am an aspiring cybersecurity professional with a diverse background in business management, data analysis, IT support, and web development. My strong curiosity and passion for solving complex challenges have driven my interest in information security, particularly in penetration testing and ethical hacking. I am currently focused on expanding my expertise in vulnerability management, threat detection, and incident response as I work toward becoming a Tier 1 Cybersecurity Analyst. For me, cybersecurity isn’t just a job—it’s a chance to protect the future, make a meaningful impact, and contribute to a safer, more resilient digital world.
