# Welcome to My Cybersecurity Portfolio

Here, you'll find a showcase of my journey through the world of cybersecurity, including hands-on projects, professional experiences, certifications, and blog-style posts sharing my thoughts and learning experiences.

## About Me

My name is Justin Goncalves, and I am an aspiring cybersecurity professional with a diverse background in business management, data analysis, IT support, and web development. My strong curiosity and passion for solving complex challenges have fueled my interest in penetration testing and ethical hacking. I am currently focused on expanding my expertise in vulnerability management, threat detection, and incident response as I work toward becoming a Tier 1 Cybersecurity Analyst. From there, I plan to gain the experience and practical knowledge needed to transition into a penetration tester role. For me, cybersecurity isn’t just a job—it’s a chance to protect the future, make a meaningful impact, and contribute to a safer, more resilient digital world.
