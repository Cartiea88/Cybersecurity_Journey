## 👨🏽‍💻 About Me
My name is Justin Goncalves, and I am an aspiring cybersecurity professional with a diverse background in business management, data analysis, IT support, and web development. My strong curiosity and passion for solving complex challenges have driven my interest in information security, particularly in **penetration testing** and **ethical hacking**. I am currently focused on expanding my expertise in vulnerability management, threat detection, and incident response as I work toward becoming a **Tier 1 Cybersecurity Analyst**. For me, _cybersecurity isn’t just a job—it’s a chance to protect the future, make a meaningful impact, and contribute to a safer, more resilient digital world._

### 📖 Background
I started my career working in pharmacy and healthcare, where I developed a passion for helping others. However, I was drawn to the endless possibilities that technology offers. My curiosity pushed me toward **web development**, which fascinated me with its constant learning opportunities and the freedom to create anything with code.

After gaining experience as a freelance web developer, I became interested in cybersecurity as I learned more about **fraud**, **hacking**, and **cybercrime**. This inspired me to dive deeper into how to **mitigate risks** and **secure digital environments**. My love of learning and commitment to protecting systems now drive me to explore every facet of the cybersecurity landscape.
